      <p>A brunch is a type of meal that is eaten between late morning and early afternoon, and combines dishes and drinks typical of the first and second meals of the day, usually starting with the sweet. The term brunch is a combination of the words breakfast and lunch. It is often presented in the form of a buffet where everyone comes to help themselves according to their tastes and appetites.
      Brunch originated in the United States before being introduced in the United Kingdom at the end of the 19th century. It appeared in France in the 1980s. In France, many cafés, hotels and restaurants offer brunch, especially on weekends. Today it is the new trend in Paris.</p>
